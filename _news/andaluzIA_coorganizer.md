I am co-organizing the next <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/andaluzia'>**Andaluz.IA**</a> forum, which will be held onsite on Friday 19th December 2025 at the <a href='https://etsi.us.es/en/etsi'>Higher Technical School of Engineering (ETSI)</a>, <a href='https://www.us.es/'>Universidad de Sevilla</a>. This unique meeting gathers multidisciplinary researchers in/from Andalusia working in the field of AI, Machine Learning and Deep Learning, and shows the potential of the community to become the AI hub in Southern Europe.
